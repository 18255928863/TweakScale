## Highlights

### KSP 1.9.x Support

The FTE-1 Drain Valve is being scaled, however not properly. Mass and size scales fine, but the drain rate is not. See Issue [#102](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/TweakScale/issues/102) for details.

Users of KSP 1.9.0 and 1.9.1 are advised to install KSP Recall. Future KSP releases may or may not fix the glitch - but until there, you need KSP Recall to use TweakScale on KSP 1.9.x . 

Keep an eye on the [Known Issues](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/TweakScale/blob/master/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) file.

This Release will be published using the following Schedule:

* GitHub, reaching first manual installers and users of KSP-AVC. Right now.
* CurseForge, Monday night
* SpaceDock (and CKAN users), Tuesday night

The reasoning is to gradually distribute the Release to easily monitor the deployment and cope with eventual mishaps.
