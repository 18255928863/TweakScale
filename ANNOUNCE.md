## Highlights

### KSP 1.9.x Support

There's a glitch on KSP 1.9.0 and 1.9.1 (and it's unknown if this will be ever fixed) that overrides any change made on the Part's Resources on *cloning* (i.e., "copy & paste" an existant part - Alt+Click, Using Symmetry, etc).

This glitch affects every single Add'On that changes the Part's Resources, it's not something affecting only TweakScale - so a fix was applied on a new Add'On called [KSP Recall](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/192048-*)

Users of KSP 1.9.0 and 1.9.1 are advised to install KSP Recall. Future KSP releases may or may not fix the glitch - but until there, you need KSP Recall to use TweakScale on KSP 1.9.x . 

Keep an eye on the [Known Issues](https://github.com/net-lisias-ksp/TweakScale/blob/master/KNOWN_ISSUES.md) file.

This Release will be published using the following Schedule:

* GitHub, reaching first manual installers and users of KSP-AVC. Right now.
* CurseForge, Right now. :P
* SpaceDock (and CKAN users), Right now. :)

The reasoning is to gradually distribute the Release to easily monitor the deployment and cope with eventual mishaps.
